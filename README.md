# Enigma
Program that reproduce the enigma machine

Hi ! Welcome to my Enigma program.

With this program, you need to enter 5 parameters:

The first one is to know if you want to encrypt your message or you want to decrypt it.
--> You just need to press enter to encrypt (it's by default) or you have to type something.
After you need to precise one position for each rotor (note that the number must be beetween 1 and 26 !)
Finaly you can enter your message.

This is the first version for the moment made on 04/09/2024.

Thanks for using my program :)
